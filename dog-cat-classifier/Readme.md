# Dog and Cat Classifier

This is a simple Streamlit application that classifies uploaded images as either a dog or a cat using a pre-trained convolutional neural network model.

## Features

- Upload an image file in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
- The app displays the uploaded image and classifies it as either a dog or a cat.



Make sure you have the trained model file `dog_cat_class.h5` in the project directory. If you don't have this file, you need to train a model and save it.

## Usage

To run the Streamlit app, execute the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
